This is the story of a crane.
A demoiselle crane named Hera.
Each year, it rises into the sky and flies over the mighty Himalayas, riding cold winds and thin air on its long journey south. It spends the winter in the warm wetlands of South India, resting, feeding, and watching the seasons change. When summer calls, the crane lifts off once more, crossing mountains and rivers to return to Siberia, where it breeds under wide northern skies before the long journey begins again.

Along the way, the crane is not alone. It flies with its mate, their wings beating in steady rhythm as they follow ancient paths in the sky. In Rajasthan, they descend together to familiar fields, stopping to rest and peck at scattered grains left after the harvest. For a little while, they share food, warmth, and quiet companionship before lifting off again, carrying their bond with them across deserts, mountains, and seasons.

Every year, as the monsoon retreats from India, a remarkable natural event takes place. Avian
winter visitors, originating from breeding grounds in Mongolia and northeastern China, flock
to the Indian Subcontinent in large numbers. This phenomenon, known as winter migrations,
sees these visitors follow dedicated routes or corridors in the Central Asian Flyway (CAF),
which is one of eight global flyways of birds. Most of these birds avoid the towering
Himalayas, choosing instead to travel through the Hindu Kush Ranges in the west and
northeast Himalayan valleys in the east to reach the Indian Subcontinent. The Great Indian
Desert or the Thar Desert are popular routes they take. One of the visitors is the red-eyed,
tall, and delicately-built Demoiselle Crane Grus virgo - also known as the Kurjan. These birds
winter in northwest India - from Rajasthan to Gujarat, western Madhya Pradesh, and
Maharashtra - and in small numbers in other states. However, a small village called Khichan
becomes the second home to thousands of Demoiselle Cranes for the whole winter, thanks to
the kind villagers who feed them and provide protection.
A Brief on Demoiselle Crane
The Demoiselle crane is the smallest in Europe; the word demoiselle has a French origin,
which means small and beautiful. It is called Karkarra in Hindi and, more profoundly, Kurjan
in Marwari. The males measure around 453 to 508 mm with a weight of 2.3 to 2.4 kgs,
whereas the females measure around 449 to 490 mm and around 1.9 to 2.7 kgs (Walkinshaw,
1973 Dementiev and Gladkov, 1968). The wintering birds in India weighed around 2.2 to
3.06 kgs (Ali and Ripley, 1969). An egg weighs 130 gm (Heinroth and Heinroth, 1926-28).
Sexual dimorphism is absent in these birds.
